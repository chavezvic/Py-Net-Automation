## What is 'import this'?
When you run `import this` in Python, it displays the "Zen of Python" â€” a collection of aphorisms that guide the philosophy of Python code development.

## Principles of the Zen of Python

Check out `zen_of_python.py` to see the Zen of Python displayed. Simply run the file in a Python environment.
You'll be presented with the foundational principles.
